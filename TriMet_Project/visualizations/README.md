## Visualizations

To check out the visualizations we created, launch the mapbox.html file. To do this, you can enable a live server extension in VS Code or your favorite GUI.  For instructions on how to do this, check out: [How to enable a Live Server extension in VS Code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-enable-live-server-on-visual-studio-code/).

We used mapbox to map the location data. Each visualization graphs a different data, described next to the graph. We exported the required data from the database and then converted the tsv file into a geojson file. Mapbox uses the geojson file to graph the data, which we then integrated into a basic website.
