<p> This repository contains projects I completed while studying for my master's degree in computer science at Portland State University.  Each project in the repository was assigned by a professor for a particular course.  The README file within each folder explains the assignment, the course it was for, and the learning objectives of the assignment. The projects vary in size depending on the length of time provided for the assignment. Some of these assignments were shorter 2-week projects, while others were developed over the better part of a term (12-weeks).
